        <h1>Nidec Press Hydraulic Circuits</h1>
        <p>
            Preface: It is recommended you complete Amatrol: Basic Hydraulics before continuing on with this 
            course. You must have a basic understanding of hydraulic schematic symbols and print reading. If you 
            have not completed either of these, contact the education center administrator to enroll.
        </p>
        <h2>Course Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This course is designed to walk a technician through the hydraulic schematics they may see out on the 
            assembly floor or customer plant. Hydraulic systems can change based on the customer need, however, 
            most hydraulic systems use functional circuit blocks. This eases the engineering and development time 
            required to design the systems from scratch. With this course, we will break the hydraulic schematics 
            down by their functional blocks and walk you through what each of these circuits does. Functional blocks
            are groups of components that will perorm a specific task. Each functional block will be noted by a number
            that represents where it is in the circuit with block 1 being the start of the circuit. Breaking complex 
            circuits into smaller, more manageable pieces will deepen our understanding of the components and function 
            of the circuit as well as lessen the burden understanding the system making it less intimidating.
        </p>
        <h2>Lesson Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In this lesson, we will take a look at the beginning of the hydraulic circuit, block 1. Block 1 is mainly 
            comprised of the reservoir, pump, and high pressure filter. These components work together to move and 
            condition the hydraulic fluid for use in the rest of the circuit. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Follow along with this <a href="./resources/hydraulicSchematic.pdf" target="_blank">print</a>. It is recommended you also use a paper copy. This will familiarize you with 
            what you will be seeing out on the assembly floor or job site.

        <h2>Hydraulic Schematics</h2>
        <p>
            Hydraulic schematics are hydraulic circuits represented with symbols. Engineers use schematics to 
            communicate the design, components, layout, and function of a hydraulic circuit. Technicians must have 
            a thorough understanding of hydraulic schematics in order to assemble and troubleshoot effectively. 
            Most press models come with separate schematics for hydraulic, pneumatic, lubrication, and electrical 
            systems. For less complicated systems, you may find schematics that incorporate more than one type of 
            system. This speeds up the development time and greatly improves troubleshooting. For simplicity of 
            more complex circuits, you will generally find the systems have been separated into their respective 
            sources.
        </p>
        <h2>Fluid Flow and Pressure</h2>
        <p>
            Hydraulic systems require hydraulic pressure to operate. The hydraulic pump in the system transfers 
            energy from the electric motor to the hydraulic fluid. This displacement of fluid and resistance to flow 
            creates pressure. Some of the energy expended by the pump will be converted into pressure while the 
            rest of the energy is converted into flow and heat. Fluids in motion exert less pressure. By causing fluid 
            flow in the hydraulic system at the pump, we create a pressure gradient or differential where 
            atmospheric pressure pushes fluid from the reservoir into the pump inlet. Once the fluid is passed 
            through the pump it is forced through the circuit where it can perform work. Fluids that perform work, 
            such as passing through a restriction or filter, will have a decrease in pressure.
        </p>
        <h2>Fluid Conditioning</h2>
        <p>
            Fluid conditioning is the act of preparing the hydraulic fluid for use in the system. This could be 
            screening, filtering, and regulating the pressure. Fluid conditioning is critical to the operation and life 
            expectancy of components within the circuit. Most hydraulic systems start with a suction strainer. This 
            strainer will normally remove the larger bits of foreign debris such as metal shavings and lint. Suction 
            strainers are selected based on the pump manufacturers recommendation for volume of flow and 
            maximum debris size that can be safely handled by the pump.
        </p>
        <h2>Prep Before Start</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="./resources/hydraulics1Prep.png" alt="">
            Check to make sure the press has been filled with the correct type and volume of hydraulic fluid. The
            type and amount will normally be listed on the manufacturing notes.
        </p>
        <h2>Block 1: Fluid Conditioning and Flow</h2>
        <p>
            The 
            <abbr class="hover_img"><a href="#">bed oil level switch <span><img src="./resources/hydraulics1ToolTip1.png" alt="image"/></span></a></abbr> 
            <a href="./resources/hydraulics1Item1.pdf" target="_blank">(1)</a> is an optic level 24VDC switch that will close and send an electrical signal 
            back to the PMC when the press has been serviced with the correct volume of hydraulic fluid. Once this 
            switch is closed, the hydraulic motor can be started. Reservoirs are responsible for holding the hydraulic 
            fluid used by the system. They will normally have more fluid than what is required to operate the system. 
            This allows for fluctuations in system demand as well as dispersing additional heat that builds up from the 
            fluid doing work. The 
            <abbr class="hover_img"><a href="#">strainer <span><img src="./resources/hydraulics1ToolTip2.png" alt="image"/></span></a></abbr>
             <a href="./resources/hydraulics1Item2.pdf" target="_blank">(2)</a> is an in-tank submerged type suction line filter that provides 140 micron 
            filtering and 30 GPM flow rate. Suction strainers are typically made of wire mesh and can be cleaned when 
            clogged to extend their service life. The 
            <abbr class="hover_img"><a href="#">shutoff valve<span><img src="./resources/hydraulics1ToolTip3.png" alt="image"/></span></a></abbr>
            <a href="./resources/hydraulics1Item3.pdf" target="_blank">(3)</a> allows you to quickly shut off fluid flow to 
            the hydraulic pump. Shutoff valves are generally provided at the beginning of hydraulic circuits for 
            emergencies and servicing purposes. The 
            <abbr class="hover_img"><a href="#">hydrauic pump<span><img src="./resources/hydraulics1ToolTip4.png" alt="image"/></span></a></abbr> 
            <a href="./resources/hydraulics1Item4.pdf" target="_blank">(4)</a> is a variable displacement medium pressure axial 
            piston pump. It has a pressure compensator (PC) built in. We will take a look at this in the next section. 
            <abbr class="hover_img"><a href="#">Filter<span><img src="./resources/hydraulics1ToolTip5.png" alt="image"/></span></a></abbr>
            FR1 <a href="./resources/hydraulics1Item5.pdf" target="_blank">(5)</a> is a 20 micron high pressure filter. A 
            <abbr class="hover_img"><a href="#">replacement element<span><img src="./resources/hydraulics1ToolTip6.png" alt="image"/></span></a></abbr> 
            <a href="./resources/hydraulics1Item6.pdf">(6)</a> will be sent out or changed 
            after the press has been manufactured. These high pressure filters are typically made of Microglass II media 
            for longer life and system protection. These cannot be cleaned or back flowed to extend their service life. 
            The style used in this schematic comes with a built-in clog detector. The model called out in this schematic 
            is electrical visual, meaning a light will illuminate and an electric signal will be sent back to the PMC to 
            alert the filter is clogged.

        <h2>Describe the function of this circuit:</h2>
        <img src="./resources/hydraulics1Function.png" alt="">
        <p>
            When the bed oil level switch closes, the hydraulic motor can be started. The hydraulic pump which is coupled 
            to the hydraulic motor will begin to operate. This will cause fluid to flow. Oil is drawn from the bed oil 
            reservoir through a strainer where the larger of the debris will be removed. The fluid will then flow through 
            the shutoff valve and into the A port of the hydraulic pump. Since there is a restriction to flow, pressure 
            will rise on the B port side of the hydraulic pump. Most of the fluid will continue to the filter segment while 
            the remainder will be used by the pressure compensator. Additional information about how the pump works can be
            found in these videos:

        <p>
            Hydraulic pressure on the B port side of the hydraulic pump will push the right side of the PC. This will 
            shift the spool once the pressure reaches the set point of the PC. The normally closed port of the PC will 
            now be connected to the pilot port of the variable displacement pump. This fluid pressure will push a plate 
            that is inside the pump, restricting the volume of hydraulic fluid the pump can draw from the reservoir. 
            Once the pressure on the B port side of the hydraulic pump is no longer at or above the set point of the PC, 
            the return spring will push the spool blocking the hydraulic fluid from acting on the pilot operator. The 
            case drain ensures fluid trapped behind the pumps mechanisms as well as the fluid acting on the pilot can 
            return to tank. Fluid trapped behind pumps will heat up and degrade, damage or destroy the seals and 
            component. The datasheet for this hydraulic pump states fluid returning to the reservoir through the case 
            drain should not exceed 230°F. 
        </p>
        <h2>High Pressure Filter Operation</h2>
        <img src="./resources/hydraulics1HighPressureFilter.png" alt="">
        <p>
            Hydraulic fluid from port B of the hydraulic pump will flow through port HP1 of the hydraulic filter assembly. 
            The larger debris (down to 140 microns) has been pre-filtered by the strainer. This provides less strain on 
            the finer 20 micron filter, extending its service life. The fluid passing through this filter will be used by 
            components with closer clearances and tolerances than those seen in the pump. Pressure present in port HP1 will 
            press on one side of the pressure differential switch. As fluid is passed through the filter it will drop in 
            pressure. This will produce a difference in pressure between port HP1 and HP2. If the pressure difference 
            becomes too great, the fluid pressure in port HP1 will activate PDS1 signaling the filter is clogged.
